# Event Coordinator

A very simple event library for nodejs.

## Concept

An event coordinator handles the coordinating of guest within an event much like a real life event ( or party ). 
Imagine and event ( Wedding event, birthday event ) that takes place on a particular place or venue.

A venue will have x amount of tables. All guests must register first before a table can be assigned.
